## 3) Core Feature Plan (As Requested)

### A) Dual Pricing / Tiered Pricing Logic
Display a **dynamic price table** on product pages:
- 1–99 units → Retail Price
- 100–499 units → Semi-Wholesale Price
- 500+ units → Wholesale Price

**UX Notes:**
- Quantity selector auto-updates per-unit price + total.
- Label savings clearly: `You save ₹X per unit on bulk orders`.
- Add `Best for Restaurants` badge at bulk tiers.

### B) B2B Focus: Wholesale Inquiry + Price List Download
- Dedicated **Wholesale Inquiry Form** with fields:
  - Business Name
  - Contact Person
  - Mobile/WhatsApp
  - City & Pincode
  - GST Number (optional)
  - Product Categories Needed
  - Monthly Quantity Requirement
  - File Upload (Excel/PDF requirement list)
- **Bulk Buyer Portal** (login required) to download:
  - Full Price List PDF
  - Updated Catalog PDF
  - MOQ and dispatch timelines

### C) Quick Re-order (Repeat Last Order)
In customer dashboard:
- A prominent button: **`Repeat Last Order`**
- One-click adds all last-order items to cart
- Option to edit quantity before checkout
- Useful for recurring B2B clients (restaurants/cafés)

### D) Inventory Visibility
Each product card + product page should show:
- `In Stock` (green badge)
- `Low Stock` (amber badge)
- `Out of Stock` (gray/red badge + Notify Me)

### E) Shipping Logic (Bulky Goods)
Shipping engine should calculate based on:
1. **Dead Weight (kg)**
2. **Volumetric Weight** = `(L x W x H in cm) / divisor`
3. Charge whichever is higher
4. Zone-wise rates (local/city/state/interstate)

**Checkout UX:**
- Show `Estimated shipping` live after pincode entry
- Mention `Bulk orders may get negotiated freight rates`
